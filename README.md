# forms

Description : 
           This is a basic web application that accepts the users data through a form.
The accepted data is sent to the server (in this case local server) and stores the data in a CSV file.
If the user asks for the data collected then the data is displayed in the form of a table in  a seperate page.

Frameworks used : Flask

What I Learned about:
      *  Using a framework 
      *  routing web pages
      *  Multi page apps
      *  Using html methods like get post delete and update
